with layouts, u define a template and the site layout will honor the template and display the components in their allotted 
slot. For example, the menu will go in menu slot, side menu in sidebar etc.

the concept is borrowed from php cms like joomla, drupal. do you know them or php

see if you can browse the code and come up with a similar design. layouts is a related term that really means 
framework for php like gantry, t3, helix etc. each has their own way of doing layout

 I am sending a joomla template. unzip it and see the site/templates folder to see what it does. then let me know 
if we can do something similar
